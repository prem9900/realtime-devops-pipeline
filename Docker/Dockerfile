 #Here's a Basic Dockerfile Template to Learn :


# Start with a base image (Node.js here, but can be Python, etc.)
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files (just placeholders for now)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (won't work unless the files exist, but okay for learning)
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the files (again, placeholder)
COPY . .

# Expose a port (just for practice)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start command (won't run anything yet)
CMD ["npm", "start"]
